Leet Add two numbers:
 In this basically we need to add 2 linked list and generate a 3rd linked list. 
 here just need to take care of conditions like 
 what if one list in null ? if one list size is smaller than another? if at the end node 
 sum of both list goes >= 10 (in this case we need to create additional node to store 10).
 every case we need to take care to run it correctly.
